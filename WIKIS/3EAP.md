## A8: Vertical prototype

> The Vertical Prototype includes the implementation of the features marked as necessary. This artifact aims to validate the architecture presented, also serving to gain familiarity with the technologies used in the project.

### 1. Implemented Features

#### 1.1. Implemented User Stories

> The following table describes the implemented user stories.

| User Story reference | Name                   | Priority                   | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
US101 | Browse Public Events | High | As a User, I want to browse public events so that I can find one that Iâ€™m interested in.Â 
US102 | View Public Event | High | As a User, I want to view a public event so that I can see the eventâ€™s information (date, time, and location).Â 
US301 | Log out | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to log out of my session so that I can share the same device with other users.Â 
US302 | Edit Profile | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to edit my profile so that I can change my personal information.Â 
US303 | View Profile | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to view my profile so that I can view my information.Â 
US304 | Create Event | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to create an event so that I can invite authenticated users and manage the event.Â 
US305 | Share Public Event with Users| High | As an Authenticated User, I want to share a public event, so that any person will be able to see the information about the event.
US306 | Join Public Event | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to be able to join a public event so that I can let the event organizer know that I am going to their event.
US307 | Manage My Events | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to manage my events so that I can organize them.
US308 | Manage Events Attended / to Attend | High | As an Authenticated User, I want to manage the events I attended/to attend so that I can organize my personal schedule accordingly.
US501 | Edit Event Details | High | As an Event Organizer, I want to edit an event's information, such as name, date, and location, so that I can keep it up to date.Â 
US502 | Manage Event Participants | High | As an Event Organizer I want to be able to manage my event participants so that I can know exactly each person's permissions.
US601 | Administer User Accounts | High | As an Administrator, I want to be able to administer user accounts so that I can have control over their actions and keep the system clean and appropriate.

> 94% of our high user stories were implemented. The missing user story is:

| User Story reference | Name                   | Priority                   | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
US103 | Search | High | As a User, I want to be able to search the entire platform so that I can find an event/user I'm looking for by using full text search, exact match, or filters.Â 


#### 1.2. Implemented Web Resources

The web resources that were implemented in the prototype are described in the next section.

> Module M01: Authentication and Individual Profile  

| Web Resource Reference | URL                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| R101: Login Form | /login |
